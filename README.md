## Ansible Playbooks
This project is a collection of Ansible playbooks that I have written throughout my career. 

## Motivation
Ansible is one of my favorite tools for infrastructure automation and I thought other DevOps Engineers might find these playbooks useful.

## Features
Automate the configuration of a self-hosted .NET 4.X GitLab Runner with the dotnet45-gitlab-runner.yaml playbook.

## Installation
[Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

## How to use?
- Run ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 on the target host
- Add the host to your Ansible hosts file
- Run the dotnet45-gitlab-runner.yaml playbook (or another playbook in the repo)

## Contribute
Pull requests are always welcome!
